We will start building our food ordering app.
For this we need to plan.
Having a big picture before starting to code is helpful to achieve what we want in the UI.

We will start by planning the layout of our app. Our app will look something like this:
  Header
    - Logo
    - Nav Items
  Body
    - Seacrch Bar
    - Restaurant Container
        - Restaurant Card
  Footer
    - Copyright
    - Links
    - Address
    - Contacts

Props:
1. Short form for properties
2. We pass properties to a component using props
3. Like a Functional component is nothing but a normal JS function, props are like normal function arguments
4. Passing a prop to a function is like passing an argument to a function
5. We pass props to react like this:

    <Component propertyName="propertyValue" /> for string values
    <Component propertyName={propertyValue} /> for other JS code like number, object, variable 

  where propertyName is a porp and propertyValue is the value we assign to the prop.

  It is like calling the function as:
    Component({ propertyName: "propertyValue" }); for string values
    Component({ propertyName: propertyValue });   for JS code like number, object, variable 

  The object that we passed to the Component function is the props
6. We need to use {} to pass JS variables or numbers, because we need {} to write JS inside JSX
7. When we have to pass in data to a component, we pass in as props
8. Whatever props we pass to a react component, react will wrap all of them in an object and pass it to the component

Config-driven UI:
  where the UI is governed by some config that is received from the backend/api

For example, the offer carousel in swiggy app will be different for different cities
