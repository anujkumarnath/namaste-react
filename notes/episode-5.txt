1. Everything we do with React can be done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then how is react helpful to us?
-> It makes us write less code and let us focus on the main business logic. It makes our coding experience fast and better.
It gives us the superpower to write production-ready applications easily.

-> It would be nice if changing the data source, updates the UI automatically. React exactly provides us with this superpower
Read react file structure from https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure

-> In our example, we are rendering multiple <RestaurantCard/> components, one for each item in the restaurant array we defined.
  But when on click of the button we filter out the restaurants and keep only the ones with a rating >= 4, the UI doesn't update.
  This is because the rendering process is over, we have already iterated over the array items and generated the output, now changing
  the array doesn't make any difference in UI.

-> All the frontend libraries, including React are solving this problem and they help us update the UI when the data source changes.
  And this is why we use something like react.

-> In react we write code in a declarative way instead of imperatively specifying how and when the UI should update.
-> We just declare the UI on each possible state and use react to handle the transition between the states.

1. Whenever we have a hardcoded value or data structure, we will not keep it inside the component file
