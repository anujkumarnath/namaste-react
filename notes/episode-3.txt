1. We can define a script to be run (the command 'npx parcel index.html') in package.json and use npm to run that script:

  "scirpts": [
    "start": "npx parcel index.html",
    "build": "npx parcel build index.html"
  ]

  We can now use "npm start"/"npm run start" and "npm run build" to start a dev server with dev build and to create a prod build respectively

  1. When we go to an uknown npm based project and we don't know how to start the project, we can see the package.json file to find which script to run
